# try-bun-with-express
Checking out bun to make express js app

so my experience from using bun from few hour.
is this thing ain't that great.
its look cool at first. until you realise it incompatible with windows.
and that exactly what caused this simple code to take a few hour. 
Setting it up take an extra time if you don't have wsl configured and ready to go.
not to mention googling stuff don't work. 
there is no one explain this other than the documentation.

maybe in few more month it will be feasible. but until then i'm back with clasic npm
